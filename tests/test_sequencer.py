"""`audioinstruments.sequencer.Sequencer`, driven by a clock a test moves.

The sequencer's whole claim is that the groove does not depend on when
`tick()` is called. So every test here calls `tick()` from a loop that also
moves the clock and applies the queue -- a transport -- and then reads what
the queue *applied*, not what the sequencer meant to do.

The queue is `tests/support/fake_pump.Events`; its docstring says what a
Python queue cannot prove. Everything below is about which frames the
sequencer writes and which ones survive an edit, a tempo change or a stop,
and none of that is the C's business.
