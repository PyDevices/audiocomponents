"""A step sequencer that keeps time in frames instead of in Python.

    from audioinstruments.sequencer import Sequencer

    seq = Sequencer(queue, sample_rate=48000, bpm=120)
    seq.track(drums, {0: (36, 42), 4: (38, 42), 8: (36, 42), 12: (38, 42)})
    seq.track(bass, {0: (33, 100, 4), 8: (40, 100, 4)})   # pitch, vel, gate
    seq.start()
    while playing:
        seq.tick()          # from a timer, as often or as rarely as you like
    seq.stop()

`tick()` tops the queue up to `ahead` steps in front of the audio and returns.
It may be called every millisecond or once a bar; it may be forty milliseconds
late because a garbage collection ran; the groove does not move, because the
step's frame was decided when it was scheduled and the pump applies it. That
is the whole difference from a `_on_step_timer` that fires the note itself.

What a step holds is a pitch, or `(pitch, velocity)`, or
`(pitch, velocity, gate)` where the gate is in steps and schedules the
note-off. A drum needs no gate; a held note does.

`bpm` may be written at any time. What has not sounded yet is cancelled and
re-laid on the new grid, phase-locked to the next step rather than to the
bar, so the tempo changes where the player asked for it.

An editor changes three more things while the bar is playing, and each has a
call: `relay()` after a pattern edit (the step is read again at the frame it
already had, so the edit is heard on the next pass of that step rather than
a bar later), `retrack()` for a change of instrument, and `position`, which
is the step the audio is in -- derived from the clock, so a late repaint
still lights the right cell. `start(step=)` picks the groove up where it was
after something reset the pump's clock.

The queue is this sequencer's. `cancel()` takes back one event by token and
is what a tempo change uses; `Events.clear()` would drop a live player's
notes too, and this never calls it.

`tick()` is **refused while the sequencer is already writing to the queue**,
and counted in `reentered`. On a board a timer callback arrives between the
interpreter's own bytecodes, so it can land inside `start()` or inside
another tick; re-entering there laid the same step twice and disarmed the
keyboard underneath a press that was still using it. See
`docs/spikes/live-audio-path-fullbar.md` in the workspace anchor.

`health()` is the four counters and the two depths in one dict, for an app
that wants to show them. The one that means a step was not heard is
`refused`: the queue has a fixed capacity, and asking for one event past it
gets a token of 0 back. `depth_needed()` says how deep a queue these tracks
want, by laying the grid rather than guessing at it, and `start()` says so
once if the queue is smaller than that.
