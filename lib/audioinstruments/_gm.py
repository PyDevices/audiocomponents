"""General MIDI's names for the percussion keys this library uses.

Every drum machine here answers GM note numbers, so one MIDI track plays on
any of them. The names live in one place because three readers want them: the
`drumkits` multi-machine instrument labels its voices from this table, the
tests render the README's kit/hit grid from it, and a person reading either
one needs them to agree.

Only the keys some machine maps are listed. A name here that nothing answers
would be a slot the library claims and does not fill.
